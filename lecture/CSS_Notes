CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

- Used to modify the appearance of a page
- CSS can select particular elements and apply styles to them
- CSS can select some components and apply a style to them
    - select all elements with a certain class, ID, the last element
    of a type on page, elements by context, etc.

- The CSS stylesheet needs to be linked to the HTML page that it is styling
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

CSS Syntax includes a:
- Selector - points to the HTML element you want to style
- Declaration Block - contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
- Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value, separated by a colon
- Declarations always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are always
surrounded by curly braces

h1 {
    color: deeppink;
    font-style: italic;
}

- Add class and id attributes to select elements and style them
    - id is used to identify one unique element
    - class is used to give elements a particular type
    - #id-value to select by id
    - .class-name to select by class
    - can use both class and id attributes for an element


- Add div and span elements to group or divide the page
    - div are dividers/boxes used to organize page
        - block tags
        - one div is the width of the page
    - span are inline elements used within paragraphs
        - inline tags
        - span element will directly follow the preceding element and will
        be directly followed by the next element
